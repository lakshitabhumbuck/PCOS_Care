        <h2>Understanding PCOS</h2>
        <p>
            PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is a hormonal disorder that affects women during their reproductive years.
            It occurs when the ovaries produce an abnormal amount of androgens — male hormones that are normally present
            in small amounts.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Features of PCOS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Irregular or missed periods</li>
            <li>Excess male hormones (androgens)</li>
            <li>Multiple small cysts in ovaries</li>
            <li>Weight gain and metabolic issues</li>
            <li>Fertility challenges</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Is PCOS treatable?</h2>
        <p>
            PCOS is a manageable condition. With early detection and lifestyle modifications such as healthy diet,
            exercise, stress reduction and medical treatment, most symptoms can be controlled effectively.
